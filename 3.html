<p >JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that conforms to
the ECMAScript specification. JavaScript is high-level, often just-in-time compiled,
and multi-paradigm. It has curly-bracket syntax, dynamic typing, prototype-based
object-orientation, and first-class functions.</p>
